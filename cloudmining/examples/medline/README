To run on all the 20M documents, we had to perform a couple of optimizations.
First of all the data was indexed by order of number of citations of each
document. Then a cutoff is chosen to stop procesing results. The natural order
of the index is used and therefore no sorting is taking place. The results are
simply returned naturally ordered by number of citations.
