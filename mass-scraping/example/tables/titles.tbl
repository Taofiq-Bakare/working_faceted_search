Another 11 wins & 13 nominations	Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption (USA) (working title)	142	Color (Technicolor)	1.85 : 1	R	At the end of the movie, there is a dedication to Allen Greene. He was Frank Darabont's agent and also a close personal friend. He died just before the completion of the movie due to AIDS complications.	Continuity: When Andy comes out of the cell in his first morning in prison, Red is shown wearing a shirt with a number that begins with 311, not beginning with a 302 which is the number on his shirt in the rest of the movie.

An office employee and a soap salesman build a global organization to help vent male aggression.	Nominated for Oscar. Another 4 wins & 14 nominations	Fight Club (Germany)	139	Color	2.35 : 1	R	Much confusion exists amongst fans about the Narrator's name. Many believe it is Jack due to his use of the phrase "I am Jack's...", but others argue that he only uses the moniker Jack because that was the one he saw in "Annotated Reader". Interestingly, in the press packages released for the movie, which came in the form of an Ikea-esque catalog, the character is referred to as Jack, as he is on the back of the DVD, and in the booklet accompanying the DVD, where the Chapter list is referred to as "Jack's Chapters". Also, the original screenplay by Jim Uhls refers to him as Jack. On the other hand, in the closed captions for the film, he is referred to as Rupert.	Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): When the narrator talks to his doctor, the x-ray on the wall behind him is not only back-to-front, but also upside-down.

Won 4 Oscars. Another 28 wins & 36 nominations	\N	136	Color (Technicolor)	2.35 : 1	R	According to costume designer Kym Barrett, Trinity's costume was made with cheap PVC because of much tighter budget. Similarly, Neo's coat wasn't actually a very expensive fabric. It was a wool blend got for three dollars a yard.	Continuity: When Morpheus escapes the military building he snaps his handcuffs but they remain on. When Neo grabs Morphous, in mid air, no handcuffs are visible. The handcuffs re-appear when Neo drops Morpheus onto one hand.

Guinness also claimed to throw away all Star Wars (1977) related fan mail without even opening it.	Continuity: Even after Darth Vader's TIE's laser hits R2, he appears undamaged for the rest of the Battle of Yavin. He doesn't even appear damaged until the return to the base following the Death Star's destruction.

The aging patriarch of an organized crime dynasty transfers control of his clandestine empire to his reluctant son.	Won 3 Oscars. Another 19 wins & 17 nominations	Mario Puzo's The Godfather (USA) (complete title)	175	Color (Technicolor)	1.85 : 1	R	Mario Puzo modeled the character of Don Vito Corleone on New York mob bosses Joe Profaci and Vito Genovese. Many of the events of his novel are based on actual incidents that occurred in the lives of Profaci, Genovese and their families. Puzo based Don Vito's personality on his own mother's.	Continuity: When Michael is telling Kay about Luca Brasi, she has a cigarette in her left hand which disappears and reappears between shots. A few seconds later, the cigarette is gone and Kay has a fork in her left hand which then jumps to her right hand.

The lives of two mob hit men, a boxer, a gangster's wife, and a pair of diner bandits intertwine in four tales of violence and redemption.	Won Oscar. Another 43 wins & 40 nominations	Black Mask (USA) (working title)	154	Color	2.35 : 1	R	Mia Wallace's television pilot involved a team of 5 female secret agents (including a blond woman, an African-American woman, and a Japanese woman). Uma Thurman's next picture with Tarantino would be Kill Bill, where she was part of a team of 5 assassins (4 of which were female and, besides her, consisted of a blond woman, and African-American woman, and a half-Japanese-half-Chinese-American woman). The French Sophie character may have also been a part of the team of assassins, making it 5. Mia's pilot character's specialty was knives. The Bride's first kill in Kill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003) was with a knife.	Revealing mistakes: When Vincent Vega drives up to the house with Mia ODing and crashes, you can see tire tracks in the grass where the original car continued through out of shot so when the camera tracks around it shows only the placed car.

Now he must embark on an Epic quest to the Cracks of Doom in order to destroy it.	Won 4 Oscars. Another 75 wins & 84 nominations	The Fellowship of the Ring (USA) (short title)@#@The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring: The Motion Picture (USA) (promotional title)	178	Color	2.35 : 1	PG-13	The Tolkien estate was never in favor of Peter Jackson's film adaptation but seeing as J.R.R. Tolkien signed the rights away in 1968 for $15,000, there was nothing they could do about it. Tolkien's grandson Simon came out in support of the production and was disowned by his relatives. Tolkien's son Christopher later retracted any opposition.	Continuity: When Arwen first approaches Frodo after he's been stabbed by the Witch-King, all of her hair is down. In the next scene when she leans over Frodo, her hair is clearly half up half down with just a few strands of hair coming down before her ears.

Batman, Gordon and Harvey Dent are forced to deal with the chaos unleashed by an anarchist mastermind known only as the Joker, as it drives each of them to their limits.	Won 2 Oscars. Another 77 wins & 59 nominations	Batman Begins 2 (USA) (working title)@#@Batman: The Dark Knight (USA) (informal title)@#@Rory's First Kiss (USA) (fake working title)@#@The Dark Knight: The IMAX Experience (USA) (IMAX version)@#@Untitled Batman Begins Sequel (USA) (working title)@#@Winter Green (USA) (fake working title)	152	Color (Technicolor)	1.44 : 1	PG-13	Just as it was when filming Batman Begins (2005), director Christopher Nolan oversaw every shot himself as there was no second unit.	Continuity: During the big-rig chase scene the length of the trailer attached to the truck changes. In one shot the truck is making a right hand turn and has a 14' trailer attached to it but when it blows up and flips over it is clearly a 48' or 53' trailer.

The former Fellowship of the Ring prepare for the final battle for Middle Earth, while Frodo & Sam approach Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring.	Won 11 Oscars. Another 106 wins & 68 nominations	Der Herr der Ringe - Die Rückkehr des Königs (Germany)@#@The Return of the King (USA) (short title)	201	Color	2.35 : 1	PG-13	Where Frodo is stabbed by Shelob's stinger, Elijah Wood was actually stabbed with a prop one. On the Extended DVD Commentary, he and Sean Astin comment that it was not only very, very painful, but had actually done damage to the point that Wood had to stay in the hospital for a couple of days. Astin (on the Commentary track) jokes that they used appendicitis as the excuse, but wonder if that event is what (ironically) caused Wood's actual episode of appendicitis later on (2003).	Revealing mistakes: In a quick shot of Gandalf holding Pippin while riding Shadowfax in front of the Black Gate you can see Billy Boyd's double's face.
